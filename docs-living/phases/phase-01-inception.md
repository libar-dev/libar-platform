## ✅ Completed Patterns

### ✅ CMS Dual Write

## CMS Dual-Write Pattern - O(1) State + Full Audit

Core types for Command Model State - the continuously updated aggregate snapshot
maintained atomically alongside events in the dual-write pattern.

### When to Use

- Defining aggregate state shapes (extend BaseCMS)
- Schema evolution with CMSUpcaster and CMSVersionConfig
- Timestamped records (use TimestampedCMS)
- Loading CMS with potential upcasting (use CMSLoadResult)

### ✅ Foundation Infrastructure

| Property | Value     |
| -------- | --------- |
| Status   | completed |

## Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure

Consolidates old roadmap phases 0-13 into a single completed milestone.

### Included Components

| Component | Package | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Event Store | platform-store | Central event storage with OCC |
| Command Bus | platform-bus | Command idempotency infrastructure |
| CMS Patterns | platform-core | Command Model State dual-write |
| Projections | platform-core | Checkpoint-based read model updates |
| Correlation | platform-core | Request tracing via correlation chains |
| EventBus | platform-core | Publish/subscribe event delivery |
| Middleware | platform-core | Command pipeline with hooks |
| Invariants | platform-core | Domain rule enforcement |

### Key Patterns Established

- **Dual-Write Pattern**: CMS update + event append atomic
- **Component Isolation**: Physical bounded context boundaries
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Workpool-Based Projections**: Durable, ordered processing
