## Dual-Write Contract - BC Type Declaration

Type-safe contract for bounded contexts using the dual-write pattern,
declaring command types, event types, and CMS table definitions for
compile-time verification and documentation generation.

### When to Use

- Declaring a bounded context's full type signature (commands, events, CMS)
- Enabling compile-time validation of command/event handlers
- Documenting BC capabilities for cross-team integration
