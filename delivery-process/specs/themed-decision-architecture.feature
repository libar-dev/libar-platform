Feature: Themed Decision Architecture

  Decisions (ADRs, PDRs) should not be "dumped into same folder" when generated.
  The synthesis of 33 active ADRs revealed natural themes and dependencies that
  should be preserved in generated documentation.

  **Context:**
  Current state: Decisions are listed chronologically or alphabetically in flat files.
  This loses the rich structure that exists in the codebase:
  - Theme groupings (Persistence, Isolation, Commands, etc.)
  - Dependency relationships (ADR-001 enables ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-005)
  - Evolutionary layers (Foundation → Infrastructure → Refinement)

  **Vision:**
  Generate themed decision documents that reflect the conceptual architecture,
  not just the chronological order of creation. Include dependency graphs
  that show how decisions build upon each other.

  **Scope:**
  1. Add theme/category tagging to decisions (`@libar-docs-adr-theme:persistence`)
  2. Generate grouped decision documents per theme
  3. Generate dependency graph visualization (ASCII or Mermaid)
  4. Port existing 33 ADRs to delivery-process format (with validity review)

  # ===========================================================================
  # Theme Structure (from synthesis)
  # ===========================================================================

  @acceptance-criteria
  Rule: Decisions are grouped by theme

    The 7 themes identified during codebase synthesis:

    | Theme        | Core ADRs               | Key Decision                          |
    | Persistence  | 001, 002, 010, 011      | Dual-write, no snapshots, lazy upcast |
    | Isolation    | 005, 023, 028, 032      | BC as components, projections at app  |
    | Commands     | 003, 017, 021, 030      | Orchestrator, idempotency, categories |
    | Projections  | 004, 006, 015, 016, 018 | Workpool, checkpoints, partitioning   |
    | Coordination | 009, 020, 025, 033      | Saga vs PM distinction                |
    | Taxonomy     | 029, 030                | Event types, command categories       |
    | Testing      | 013, 022, 031           | BDD, inverted pyramid, namespace      |

    Scenario: Generate themed decision document
      Given decisions tagged with "@libar-docs-adr-theme:persistence"
      When running the themed-decisions generator
      Then output file "docs-living/decisions/PERSISTENCE.md" is created
      And it contains ADRs 001, 002, 010, 011 grouped together
      And the theme description appears as header

    Scenario: Theme tag in decision file
      Given an ADR feature file
      When adding theme classification
      Then it includes "@libar-docs-adr-theme:<theme-name>"
      And theme-name is one of: persistence, isolation, commands, projections, coordination, taxonomy, testing

  # ===========================================================================
  # Dependency Relationships
  # ===========================================================================

  @acceptance-criteria
  Rule: Decisions declare dependencies

    Scenario: ADR with dependency declaration
      Given ADR-016 (Checkpoint) depends on ADR-002 (Event Store)
      When the ADR file includes "@libar-docs-depends-on:002"
      Then the dependency graph shows ADR-002 → ADR-016

    Scenario: Generate dependency graph
      Given all ADRs are tagged with their dependencies
      When running the dependency-graph generator
      Then output includes ASCII or Mermaid diagram
      And the diagram shows the dependency tree:
        """
        ADR-001 (Dual-Write)
        ├── ADR-002 (Event Store)
        │   └── ADR-016 (Checkpoint)
        │       └── ADR-015 (Workpool)
        │           └── ADR-018 (Partitioning)
        ├── ADR-003 (Command Bus)
        │   └── ADR-017 (Idempotency)
        │       └── ADR-021 (Orchestrator)
        └── ADR-005 (BC as Component)
            └── ADR-023 (Proj at App)
        """

  # ===========================================================================
  # Evolutionary Layers
  # ===========================================================================

  @acceptance-criteria
  Rule: Decisions are layered by evolution phase

    The 33 ADRs fall into 3 evolutionary layers:

    | Layer          | ADR Range | Count | Description                    |
    | Foundation     | 001-010   | 10    | Core patterns, first decisions |
    | Infrastructure | 011-020   | 10    | Supporting infrastructure      |
    | Refinement     | 021-033   | 13    | Optimizations, clarifications  |

    Scenario: Layer information in generated docs
      Given a themed decision document
      When it renders ADR entries
      Then each entry shows its layer badge (Foundation/Infrastructure/Refinement)
      And the layer provides context for the decision's maturity

  # ===========================================================================
  # Migration Strategy
  # ===========================================================================

  @acceptance-criteria
  Rule: Existing ADRs are migrated with review

    Scenario: Port ADR from old format to feature file
      Given an existing ADR in "docs/architecture/decisions/adr-001-*.md"
      When migrating to delivery-process format
      Then create "deps/libar-dev-packages/packages/tooling/delivery-process/tests/features/decisions/adr-001-*.feature"
      And include original decision content in Gherkin format
      And add theme, layer, and dependency tags
      And mark status (active, superseded, deprecated)

    Scenario: Review for validity during migration
      Given an ADR being migrated
      When the content is reviewed
      Then check if decision is still accurate
      And check if it has been superseded by newer decisions
      And check if implementation matches the decision
      And update status accordingly

  # ===========================================================================
  # Generated Artifacts
  # ===========================================================================

  @acceptance-criteria
  Rule: Multiple output formats are generated

    Scenario: Generate all decision artifacts
      Given all decisions are tagged with theme, layer, and dependencies
      When running "pnpm docs:decisions"
      Then the following are generated:
        | Artifact                              | Content                        |
        | docs-living/decisions/INDEX.md        | Master index with all ADRs     |
        | docs-living/decisions/PERSISTENCE.md  | Persistence theme decisions    |
        | docs-living/decisions/ISOLATION.md    | Isolation theme decisions      |
        | docs-living/decisions/COMMANDS.md     | Commands theme decisions       |
        | docs-living/decisions/PROJECTIONS.md  | Projections theme decisions    |
        | docs-living/decisions/COORDINATION.md | Coordination theme decisions   |
        | docs-living/decisions/TAXONOMY.md     | Taxonomy theme decisions       |
        | docs-living/decisions/TESTING.md      | Testing theme decisions        |
        | docs-living/decisions/DEPENDENCY.md   | Dependency graph visualization |
